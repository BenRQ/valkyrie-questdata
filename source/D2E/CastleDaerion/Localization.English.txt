quest.name,Castle Daerion
quest.description,My own version of Castle Daerion. Based on the original quest but modified to fit the Road to Legend rules/feel. Not playtested for difficulty balance yet (I was aiming for something more on the hard side) but it should work perfectly mechanically. May contain typos as English is not my first language.
